# fluidsim

I've been playing with #Flutter #FlameEngine again, to create a real time fluid simulation. Based on [this video by thecodingtrain](https://youtube.com/watch?v=alhpH6ECFvQ), using Mike Ash's paper [Fluid Simulation for Dummies](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html) as a reference. I ported the code shown in the video to Flutter. And voila !
